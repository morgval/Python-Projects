# Python Projects
A catalog of one-off projects I did to complete the Odin Project, Coursera, and freeCodeCamp certifications.
| Project | Provider | Description | Date Completed | Link to Repository |
|---------|----------|-------------|----------------|--------------------|
| Google Homepage | [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) | No longer apart of their curriculum, but this project gave me a solid understanding of basic HTML and CSS. I struggled most with getting each item to in the position it's supposed to be on the page | Dec 2019 | [Google Homepage](https://github.com/morgval/google-homepage) |
| Arithmetic Arranger | [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/scientific-computing-with-python-projects/arithmetic-formatter) | First freeCodeCamp project for Scientific Computing.  Takes a list of addition or subtraction problems and formats them vertically.  If the second argument is True, it will also solve them. | In progress | [Arithmetic Arranger](https://github.com/morgval/Arithmetic-Arranger) |
| Statistics Calculator | [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/data-analysis-with-python-projects/mean-variance-standard-deviation-calculator) | First freeCodeCamp project for Data Analysis.  Calculates mean, variance, std, max, min, and sum (I also added the quartiles as well) | Incomplete | |
